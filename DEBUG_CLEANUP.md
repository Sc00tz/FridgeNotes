# Debug files removed for production cleanup

The following files were temporary debugging scripts created during development
and have been removed for a cleaner production environment:

## Removed Files:
- debug_db_state.py
- debug_definitive.py 
- debug_frontend_data.js
- debug_label_deletion.py
- debug_label_frontend.js
- debug_labels.py
- test_api_direct.sh
- test_fix_verification.js
- test_label_removal.js
- browser_label_test.js
- TEST_LABELS.js

## Kept Files:
- README.md (main documentation)
- FEATURES.md (feature documentation)
- DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md (deployment instructions)
- Docker files (docker-compose.yml, Dockerfile)
- Migration scripts (migrate_db.py, etc.)
- Core application code (src/, fridgenotes-frontend/)

The debugging functionality has been removed from the application code and 
the label removal feature is now working correctly.
