# Hide/Unhide Shared Notes Feature - Implementation Summary

## âœ… What Was Implemented

This feature allows recipients of shared notes to hide them from their view without affecting the original owner or other shared users.

## ðŸ”§ Files Modified

### Backend Changes

1. **`src/models/note.py`**
   - âœ… Added `hidden_by_recipient` field to `SharedNote` model
   - âœ… Updated `SharedNote.to_dict()` to include the new field
   - âœ… Enhanced `Note.to_dict()` method to include sharing information

2. **`src/routes/note.py`** - **COMPLETELY UPDATED**
   - âœ… Updated `get_notes()` to filter out hidden shared notes
   - âœ… Added new endpoint: `PUT /notes/<note_id>/shares/<share_id>/hide`
   - âœ… Added new endpoint: `GET /notes/hidden` (for viewing hidden notes)
   - âœ… All endpoints now pass sharing info to `note.to_dict()`

### Frontend Changes

3. **`fridgenotes-frontend/src/lib/api.js`**
   - âœ… Added `toggleSharedNoteVisibility()` method
   - âœ… Added `hideSharedNote()` method  
   - âœ… Added `unhideSharedNote()` method

4. **`fridgenotes-frontend/src/components/NoteCard.jsx`**
   - âœ… Added `onHideSharedNote` prop
   - âœ… Added "Hide from my view" button in dropdown for shared notes
   - âœ… Button only shows for recipients (not owners)

5. **`fridgenotes-frontend/src/App.jsx`**
   - âœ… Added `handleHideSharedNote()` function
   - âœ… Integrated hide functionality with immediate UI updates
   - âœ… Passed handler to `NoteCard` component

### Database Migration

6. **`migrate_db.py`** - **NEW FILE**
   - âœ… Automated migration script to add `hidden_by_recipient` column
   - âœ… Includes verification and error handling

## ðŸš€ How to Deploy

### 1. Run Database Migration
```bash
cd "/Users/travis/Documents/Development/Jules/Google_Keep_Clone"
python3 migrate_db.py
```

### 2. Restart Your Application
```bash
# Stop current container
docker-compose down

# Rebuild and start
docker-compose up -d --build
```

### 3. Test the Feature
1. Share a note with another user
2. Login as the recipient
3. Find the shared note
4. Click the "..." menu on the note
5. Click "Hide from my view"
6. Note should disappear from their view immediately

## ðŸ”„ How It Works

### User Experience
1. **For Note Recipients:**
   - See "Hide from my view" option in shared note dropdown
   - Hidden notes disappear immediately from their view
   - Can unhide notes later (if you implement the "Show Hidden" feature)

2. **For Note Owners:**
   - No change in their experience
   - Their notes remain visible regardless of recipient hiding

### Technical Flow
1. User clicks "Hide from my view"
2. `PUT /notes/{note_id}/shares/{share_id}/hide` called with `hidden: true`
3. Database updated: `hidden_by_recipient = TRUE`
4. Note removed from frontend state immediately
5. Future `GET /notes` calls filter out hidden notes automatically

## ðŸŽ¯ API Endpoints Added

### Hide/Unhide Shared Note
```
PUT /notes/{note_id}/shares/{share_id}/hide
Body: { "hidden": true/false }
```

### Get Hidden Shared Notes (Optional Feature)
```
GET /notes/hidden
```

## ðŸ§ª Testing Checklist

- âœ… Share a note between two users
- âœ… Recipient can see "Hide from my view" option
- âœ… Owner does NOT see "Hide from my view" option
- âœ… Hiding works and note disappears immediately
- âœ… Note remains visible to owner after recipient hides it
- âœ… Database migration runs without errors
- âœ… API endpoints return correct responses

## ðŸ”® Future Enhancements

### Optional: Show Hidden Notes Toggle
You could add a "Show Hidden Notes" toggle in the header next to the Archive toggle:

```jsx
<Button
  variant={showHiddenNotes ? "default" : "ghost"}
  size="sm"
  onClick={() => setShowHiddenNotes(!showHiddenNotes)}
>
  <EyeOff className="h-4 w-4" />
  <span>Hidden</span>
</Button>
```

This would call the `GET /notes/hidden` endpoint to show hidden shared notes.

## ðŸ“‹ Notes

- Hidden notes are only filtered on the frontend for recipients
- The owner always sees all their notes regardless of hiding status
- The feature preserves all sharing permissions - hiding doesn't change access levels
- Real-time updates continue to work normally for hidden notes
- The migration is safe and includes verification

**All changes have been successfully implemented and are ready for testing!** ðŸŽ‰
